# Introduction to Statistical Learning with Python
Recreating the labs from [ISLR](http://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/) using Python and libraries including pandas and scikit-learn

## Python
I decided to try this translation to the python world because I've already been through the book in R, I could stand to improve my python/pandas/scikit, and I just like the book's presentation in general :)
